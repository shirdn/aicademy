# The Arcane Vault — Memory Match

> D&D-themed memory card game with shaped grid levels.
> Built with AI vibe coding using the [AIcademy scaffold](../AIcademy-scaffold/README.md).

---

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3** — the only requirement. Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  - Windows: check **"Add Python to PATH"** during install
  - Mac: `brew install python3`
  - Linux: `sudo apt install python3`
- **A browser** — Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari

No Node.js. No npm. No build step.

---

## Quick Start

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell):
.\start.ps1
```

```bash
# Mac / Linux:
./start.sh
```

```bash
# Or manually (any OS):
cd frontend/modules/game/src
python3 -m http.server 8766
# Open http://localhost:8766
```

The script checks for Python, starts the server, and opens your browser automatically.

> **Note:** This project was developed and tested on Windows. It has not been tested on a clean machine or on Mac/Linux — minor adjustments to paths or Python commands may be needed. But hey, that's what vibe coding is for — ask your AI to fix it and move on.

## How to Play

### 1. Main Menu
The game opens to the **Arcane Vault** title screen with a fan of floating creature cards. Click **"Enter the Vault"** to begin.

### 2. Choose Your Quest (Level Select)
Pick from 8 shaped levels, each with increasing difficulty:

| # | Level | Shape | Pairs | Time | Difficulty |
|---|-------|-------|-------|------|------------|
| 1 | The Pillar | `1` | 5 | 60s | Easy |
| 2 | The Cross | `+` | 6 | 90s | Easy |
| 3 | The Tablet | `T` | 8 | 80s | Easy |
| 4 | The Arch | `A` | 10 | 120s | Medium |
| 5 | The Serpent | `S` | 12 | 100s | Medium |
| 6 | The Diamond | `diamond` | 10 | 100s | Medium |
| 7 | The Gate | `H` | 10 | 110s | Hard |
| 8 | The Star | `star` | 16 | 90s | Legendary |

Each level card shows a **mini-preview** of the shape, pair count, time limit, and difficulty badge.

### 3. Gameplay
- **Click a card** to flip it and reveal the creature underneath
- **Click a second card** to try for a match
- **Match** (same creature) = both cards stay face-up with a glow effect
- **Mismatch** = cards shake and flip back after a moment
- Match all pairs before the **timer** runs out

### 4. Scoring
- **Stars** (1-3) based on speed and accuracy:
  - 1 star = complete within the time limit
  - 2 stars = complete with few mistakes (moves <= 2x pair count)
  - 3 stars = near-perfect play (moves <= 1.5x pairs AND >= 50% time remaining)
- **XP** = base (pairs x 100) + time bonus + star bonus
- Full XP breakdown shown on the results screen

### 5. After the Round
- **Play Again** = retry the same level for better stars
- **Level Select** = pick a different level
- **Main Menu** = back to the start

### Key Algorithms

| Function | What It Does |
|----------|-------------|
| `makeTemplate(pattern)` | Parses `#..#/####` pattern strings into grid slot arrays |
| `validateTemplate(t)` | Checks even pairs, no overlap, in bounds, 3-24 pair range |
| `buildCards(slots)` | Assigns creature symbols to slots, Fisher-Yates shuffle |
| `calculateStars(moves, pairs, elapsed, timeLimit)` | 1-3 stars based on move ratio + time ratio |
| `calculateXP(pairs, elapsed, timeLimit, stars)` | Base + time bonus + star bonus |

### The Shaped Grid System

Levels are defined as **pattern strings** where `#` = card slot and `.` = empty space:

```
The Cross (+):        The Arch (A):
  .##.                  ..###..
  .##.                  .#...#.
  ####                  #.....#
  ####                  #.....#
  .##.                  #######
  .##.                  #.....#
                        #.....#
```

Empty cells create the **negative space** that forms the shape. The shape IS the level.

## Visual Identity — Arcane UI Kit

| Element | Token | Value |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Background | `void` | `#030010` (deepest violet-black) |
| Card fill | `nightstone` | `#160a35` |
| Primary accent | `arcane` | `#a78bfa` (purple) |
| Rewards ONLY | `gold` | `#fbbf24` |
| Match glow | `success` | `#34d399` |
| Timer warning | `danger` | `#f87171` |
| Headings | MedievalSharp | Fantasy display font |
| Body text | Crimson Text | Elegant serif |
| Stats/data | Fira Code | Monospace |

**Rules:** No gray anywhere (all neutrals are violet-tinted). Gold is earned, never decorative.

## How It Was Built (Vibe Coding)

```
1. CTO planned    ->  PRD, architecture, shaped grid system design
2. DEV built      ->  18 tasks in Sprint 01 (all complete)
3. QA verified    ->  8 Playwright E2E tests + screenshots
4. Decisions logged in docs/DECISIONS.md
```

All artifacts live in `docs/sprints/sprint_01/` — the sprint index, task list, and report.
